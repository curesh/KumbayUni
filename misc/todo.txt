0. Make todo list

1. Start working on a python program that given a zoom recording, anonymizes faces
   a. Work on anonymizing regions in the zoom drop down menu that stay relatively
   static
   b. Work on anonymizing regions in the zoom drop down menu during the times
   that they are being moved around
   c. Anonymize the faces that are shown on the screen before screensharing is active
   
2. Setup database somehow using sqlite

3. Figure out what you need to do to get the preliminary backend working

4. For now, you just want a video uploading pipeline

Features:
1. A textbox that allows people to submit time points in the video that need to be blacked out or something
2. Anonymization
3. Tree Structure Repository
4. Search box for finding video
5. Make account (to upload not view)
6. Upload video (it gets processed automatically and the anonymized version is uploaded)
   a. First step would be to 


Urgent Todo for tmrw:
1. Now, get notification system working for background jobs.
2. (Done check) It is a good idea to create a bulk upload option in the forms where you can upload a zip without having to enter in all those boxes for each one
3. FavIcon
4. deploy
5. (Maybe) Make the smooth blur box size increase a function of the fps downsampling (cause sometimes it increases a lot and sometimes it doesn't)
6. Record your own zoom video as a demo on the website
Status:
Also need to fully deploy website onto the infinityfree domain or heroku.

Ways to lower execution time:
1. downsample video altogether at beginning instead of frame by frame
